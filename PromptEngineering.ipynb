The formula 1/2 x base x height is straightforward but can only be used for right triangles or when the height is perpendicular to the base. The pythagorean method is also limited to right triangles, but it gives us additional information about the triangle's height. On the other hand, Heron's formula can be used for any triangle and provides us the area directly using the length of all sides. However, it involves a more complicated process of calculation.

The pros of this solution are that it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase soil health, and improve crop yields. However, the cons are that it may require significant changes in farming practices, which may not be feasible for all farmers. Additionally, it may take several years for sustainable agricultural practices to have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The feasibility of this solution depends on the availability of resources and support for sustainable agriculture. The probability of success is high if there is a strong commitment to sustainable agriculture and support for farmers to adopt new practices.\n",

            "Overall, all three solutions have their pros and cons, feasibility, and probability of success. However, a combination of all three solutions may be the most effective way to reduce the impact of climate change on extreme weather events. It is important to have a strong commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainable land use practices, and investing in renewable energy sources to mitigate the impact of climate change on extreme weather events.\n"
